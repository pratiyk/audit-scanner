## Overview:
This script is designed to scan a specified file or directory for known vulnerabilities using Retire.js. It prompts the user for a path, checks if Retire.js is installed (installing it if necessary), and then runs a Retire.js scan on the provided path.

## Prerequisites:
Node.js and npm should be installed on your system.

## Usage:
- Run the Script
    - Execute the script from your terminal:
      
      ```
      ./script_name.sh
      ```
- Provide Path
    - When prompted, enter the file or directory path you want to scan.
      
- Scan Results
    - The script will install Retire.js if it is not already installed.
    - It will then run a Retire.js scan on the specified path and display the results.
